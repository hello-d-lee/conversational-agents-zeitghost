    "### GDELT\n",
    "Supported by Google Jigsaw, the [GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, themes, sources, emotions, counts, quotes, images and events driving our global society every second of every day, creating a free open platform for computing on the entire world.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>\"The GDELT Project is an initiative to construct a catalog of human societal-scale behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world, connecting every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what's happening around the world, what its context is and who's involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day.\"</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring nearly the entire world's news media is only the beginning - even the largest team of humans could not begin to read and analyze the billions upon billions of words and images published each day. GDELT uses some of the world's most sophisticated computer algorithms, custom-designed for global news media, running on \"one of the most powerful server networks in the known Universe\", together with some of the world's most powerful deep learning algorithms, to create a realtime computable record of global society that can be visualized, analyzed, modeled, examined and even forecasted. A huge array of datasets totaling trillions of datapoints are available. Three primary data streams are created, one codifying physical activities around the world in over 300 categories, one recording the people, places, organizations, millions of themes and thousands of emotions underlying those events and their interconnections and one codifying the visual narratives of the world's news imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three streams update every 15 minutes, offering near-realtime insights into the world around us. Underlying the streams are a vast array of sources, from hundreds of thousands of global media outlets to special collections like 215 years of digitized books, 21 billion words of academic literature spanning 70 years, human rights archives and even saturation processing of the raw closed captioning stream of almost 100 television stations across the US in collaboration with the Internet Archive's Television News Archive. Finally, also in collaboration with the Internet Archive, the Archive captures nearly all worldwide online news coverage monitored by GDELT each day into its permanent archive to ensure its availability for future generations even in the face of repressive forces that continue to erode press freedoms around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed GDELT documentation links for various datasets and source formats can be found [here](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html) (scroll down to documentation). See the [GCAM Master Codebook](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GCAM-MASTER-CODEBOOK.TXT) for a list of all of the dimensions available and the [Global Knowledge Graph 2.0 Codebook](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Global_Knowledge_Graph_Codebook-V2.pdf) (scroll down to the GCAM field) for more details on the file format of the GCAM field and how to work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these notebooks, we will focus on the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph dataset, publicly available for anyone to use in [Google BigQuery](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "From the very beginning, one of the greatest challenges in working with GDELT has been in how to interact with a dataset of this magnitude. Few database platforms can handle a dataset this complex with the sheer variety of access patterns and the number of permutations of fields that are collected together into queries each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's BigQuery database was custom-designed for datasets like GDELT, enabling near-realtime adhoc querying over the entire dataset. This means that no matter how you access GDELT, what columns you look across, what kinds of operators you use, or the complexity of your query, you will still see results pretty much in near-realtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "For us, the most groundbreaking part of having GDELT in BigQuery is that it opens the door not only to fast complex querying and extracting of data, but also allows for the first time real-world analyses to be run entirely in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine computing the most significant conflict interaction in the world by month over the past 35 years, or performing cross-tabbed correlation over different classes of relationships between a set of countries. Such queries can be run entirely inside of BigQuery and return in just a handful of seconds. This enables you to try out \"what if\" hypotheses on global-scale trends in near-real time. We'll also show how you can orchestrated and schedule ongoing data updates from the dataset to ensure your data stays up to date with the required latency. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will \n",

    "\n",
    "- GDELT Event Data \n",
    "    - Specify the parameters of interest (topic(s), time)\n",
    "    - Run the extraction process, generate full article content\n",
    "    - Load and label this data back into BigQuery destination tables\n",
    "- GDELT Entity Graph Data \n",
    "    - Specify the parameters of interest (actor(s), time)\n",
    "    - Run the extraction process, generate full article content\n",
    "    - Load and label this data back into BigQuery destination tables\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have run this notebook, you may want to set up a recurring schedule for extraction of the GDELT data - the [GDELT Pipelines Notebook]() shows how to create an end to end pipeline including updating the Matching Engine Vector store with the latest GDELT data."
